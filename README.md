# Minerva, A Graph Based Matrix Math Library

Minerva is meant to be a library for setting up and executing graph based equations in a platform and workload
agnostic way


Roadmap:
    Jank speed up
    Full working feed forward network
    Added in BLAS for basic matrix speed up
    Rust-gpu
    Gpu code
    Integrate Rust GPU to allow you to write and deploy your own kernels on the GPU
    Allow the equations to introspect it's workload and make choices on where it should run
        it's current workload for best performance.
    ML wrapper layer
    CV wrapper layer
